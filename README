Due to cross-platform stupidity and me being a lazy bastard, you're going to 
need to have this running on a (local) web server. Simple enough on e.g. 
OS X, just run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" in the same directory and open 
localhost:8000. Go ahead and patch this if you want, I can't be arsed right 
now.

Greetings to RHD, Sonikkk, Komplex and Accession. 

Fuckings to all lamers and JBB.

Someone should send stamps back.
